# Contributing to Accessibility Mod Template

## About This Project

For now, this merely is a **template of a template** - a foundation for starting accessibility modding projects with Claude Code. It was created by a blind screen reader user working with Claude Code, without significant coding experience.

My goal is to help newbies like myself get started with their accessibility modding projects with:
- Strong technical foundation
- Good coding practices from the start
- Protection against common pitfalls
- Clear guidance for Claude Code to follow

## How You Can Help

### 1. Share What Works
**If you've used this template or started your own accessibility mod:**

- What was missing or confusing?
- What additional templates or documentation would help?
- What prompts or instructions helped Claude Code produce better code?

### 2. Technical Feedback (Especially from Programmers)
**I'd love to receive honest feedback:**
- Where does it show this was created without traditional coding knowledge?
- What coding patterns should be improved?
- What architectural decisions need reconsidering?
- What common mistakes should the template help avoid?
- Are the code templates following best practices?

Don't hold back - constructive criticism helps make this better for everyone.
